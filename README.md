This repo contains my laboratory projects done at the University.
All these works run on Linux environment.


+ **The C-project** folder consists on some exercises made by myself and by my exam task.
+ **The Cpp-project** folder contains exercises written during classes and laboratory. The main goal of these scripts is to interpolate the data obtained in the various laboratory sessions using ROOT, a framework developed by CERN.
